# Image Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is an image recognition system that utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images into different categories. The system is built using Python and leverages popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Features
- Image classification using a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet)
- Custom dataset support for training and fine-tuning
- Real-time image recognition using a webcam
- GUI support for easy image upload and recognition
- Model performance evaluation and accuracy metrics

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-recognition.git
cd image-recognition
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation
1. Download or collect images for training and testing.
2. Organize them into separate folders (e.g., `train/` and `test/`).
3. If using a pre-trained model, ensure images match the required input size.

## Model Training
To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py --dataset_path ./data --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

## Model Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model:
```sh
python evaluate.py --model_path ./models/saved_model.pth
```

## Real-time Image Recognition
For real-time classification using a webcam:
```sh
python recognize.py --webcam
```

## API Usage
The project includes an API for image recognition.
Run the API server:
```sh
python app.py
```
Use the API endpoint to classify an image:
```sh
curl -X POST -F "file=@image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

## GUI Application
To use the graphical interface for uploading images:
```sh
python gui.py
```

## Model Performance
- The model achieves **XX% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- Loss and accuracy metrics are logged during training.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Flask (for API)
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## Future Enhancements
- Implement object detection alongside classification.
- Deploy the model as a cloud-based service.
- Optimize model performance for mobile devices.
